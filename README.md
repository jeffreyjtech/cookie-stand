## Reflections and Comments

### Lab 06

- While creating the first draft of this website, it was a bit hard to decide what the best way forward was. It's very clear that we'll be making *significant* changes to the code in the coming days. I ended up writing some code in a different structure than I might otherwise.
- I felt confident working with what we had learned today. Without really understanding it, I used the DOM to make my Class 102 website. I was well prepared having worked with it before, reading about it yesterday, and then learning about it through lecture.
