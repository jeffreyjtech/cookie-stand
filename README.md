## Reflections and Comments

### Lab 06

- While creating the first draft of this website, it was a bit hard to decide what the best way forward was. It's very clear that we'll be making *significant* changes to the code in the coming days. I ended up writing some code in a different structure than I might otherwise.
- I felt confident working with what we had learned today. Without really understanding it, I used the DOM to make my Class 102 website. I was well prepared having worked with it before, reading about it yesterday, and then learning about it through lecture.

### Lab 07

- Constructors are a great way to make object instantiation *dry*. I even went so far as to create a function which loops through my Store constructor with multiple stores' data.
  - The function can take Salmon Cookies store data (in an array), construct one or more Store object(s) with that data, then push the constructed Store(s) into another array.
  - With this, I can create as many Store objects as I want without having to write code to instantiate each one individually.
  - Also, in theory, this allows me to dynamically add more stores to the sales table.
- Appending a table to the sales page was almost more difficult to code than coding the constructor and contructor loop but I got through it.
- I really feel like the doors are opening on what I can do with JavaScript.

### Lab 08

- The CSS for this iteration of the site was a challenge. I took just enough time to get the homepage laid out *reasonably* well. Shout-out to my classmate, Nicholas M., for helping out with the wireframe lab (I'll add a link to his GitHub when I find it), which I completed before starting on this. The wisdom he shared was crucial to completing both labs.
- The site is lacking the finer CSS tweaks to make the site attractive, but I'll make time for that before final submission.
- Fortunately, I had all the JavaScript components completed in Lab 07 (not including stretch goals), so that was

### Lab 09

- It took a bit of re-organization and forethought, but getting the submission form added was relatively easy.
- The hardest part was deciding what the "best" way of formatting the HTML would be. As nice as semantic tags are, their existence leads me to overthink what the best element is or hesitate using a certain semantic element because it might not be "semantically correct".
