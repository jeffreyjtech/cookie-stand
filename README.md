## Reflections and Comments

### Lab 06

- While creating the first draft of this website, it was a bit hard to decide what the best way forward was. It's very clear that we'll be making *significant* changes to the code in the coming days. I ended up writing some code in a different structure than I might otherwise.
- I felt confident working with what we had learned today. Without really understanding it, I used the DOM to make my Class 102 website. I was well prepared having worked with it before, reading about it yesterday, and then learning about it through lecture.

### Lab 07

- Constructors are a great way to make object instantiation *dry*. I even went so far as to create a function which loops through my Store constructor with multiple stores' data.
  - The function can take Salmon Cookies store data (in an array), construct one or more Store object(s) with that data, then push the constructed Store(s) into another array.
  - With this, I can create as many Store objects as I want without having to write code to instantiate each one individually.
  - Also, in theory, this allows me to dynamically add more stores to the sales table.
- Appending a table to the sales page was almost more difficult to code than coding the constructor and contructor loop but I got through it.
- I really feel like the doors are opening on what I can do with JavaScript.
